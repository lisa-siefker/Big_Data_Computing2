# Problem Statement
Assume that you are the Director of Data Science for Buckeye Resorts, Inc. (BRI), an international hotel chain. As is the case for all hotel chains, reservation cancellations cause significant impacts to BRI, in profitability, logistics, and other areas. The cost to BRI of a cancelled reservation is $500 on average.

BRI wants to improve (decrease) the cancellation rates at its hotels, using more tailored interventions, based on newly available detailed data. BRI processes 100,000 reservations per year, so an incremental improvement in cancellation rates would have a significant impact.

One intervention being considered is to offer a special financial incentive to customers who have reservations, but who are “at risk” of cancellation. BRI has performed a small pilot test, and has found that offering a $100 discount to a customer who is planning to cancel is effective 30% of the time in inducing the customer not to cancel (by locking in a no-cancellation clause in exchange for the discount).

BRI leadership asked your team to analyze the new data, and determine if it is suitable for developing analyses and models that would be effective in predicting which future reservations are likely to be at risk of cancellation, so the aforementioned financial incentive could be offered.

The head of BRI would then like you attend the upcoming BRI Board of Directors meeting. She has asked you to present your findings to her and to the BOD, to help them decide whether to go forward with the planned tailored intervention approach, and/or to adjust or abandon the approach. Your goal is to support the BOD in making a decision.
